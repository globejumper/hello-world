# hello-world
my first repository, trying to get into this whole programming world and all

Learning Ruby, but more so trying to rewire my brain to think like a problem-solver
Trying to implement the scientific method in my programming and using Test Driven Development 
to churn out code effectively and with understanding of why it behaves the way it does.
